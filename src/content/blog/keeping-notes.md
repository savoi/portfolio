Publishing in-progress thinking has been one of the most useful ways to make learning stick. Instead of hoarding notes in private notebooks, I've started to share artefacts as they happen: audio snippets, moodboards, prompts, even half-finished prototypes.

## Lightweight workflows

1. **Capture ruthlessly.** Voice memos, quick sketches, terminal recordings—anything ephemeral gets saved to a "scratch" folder.
2. **Triage weekly.** I set aside time to re-read and tag what still feels interesting.
3. **Publish tiny.** Not everything needs a full essay. A paragraph and a couple of links often does the job.

## Share the process

Artefacts aren't just outputs; they document the journey. By making them public, collaborators can peek into evolving ideas and offer feedback before things calcify.

If you'd like me to cover specific habits or tools, let me know!
