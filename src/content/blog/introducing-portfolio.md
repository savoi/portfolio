Welcome to the newest iteration of my digital home. I wanted something fast, content-first, and friendly to maintain. Astro ticks all those boxes and more.

## Why Astro?

Astro's focus on shipping zero-JS by default means I can obsess over the writing and storytelling without pulling in heavy frameworks. Content collections keep everything typed and organized, while MDX (coming soon!) will let me mix prose with interactive demos.

## What's inside

- A project index that pulls from a structured data collection
- A blog that I can extend with Markdown or MDX as needed
- A drawer for "artefacts"—those odd files, PDFs, and experiments that don't fit elsewhere

## Roadmap

I'll be expanding the design system, adding light/dark mode toggles, and publishing a few deep dives into the tools behind my workflow. Stay tuned!
